                Hello! My name is Badreddine Ibzazne. I hold a Master's degree in Chemistry and have recently
                made a career shift to become a Software Developer. Currently, I am a student at EMSI, where
                I am broadening my knowledge and skills in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my studies, I am also working as the Vice Director at the CPGE IbnGhazi
                center, where I have the opportunity to apply my leadership skills and contribute to the
                growth and success of the center.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong background in Chemistry and an ever-growing passion for software development,
                I am eager to take on new challenges and make a positive impact in the tech industry.
